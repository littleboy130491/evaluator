## 5. Check & Validation
- **Validation Date:** 2024-08-12  
- **Criteria Met?** ✅ (Partially)  
- **Details:** Core functionality for roles and permissions is implemented and working. Filament Shield provides the admin panel authentication. Standard web authentication routes need implementation for non-admin users.

---

## 6. Failure Report (If Criteria Not Met)
- **Reason(s):** Standard web authentication routes (login, register, logout) are not fully implemented for non-admin users. User management routes for creating, editing, and deleting users via web interface are not implemented.
- **Related Files:** tests/Feature/UserAuthenticationTest.php, tests/Feature/UserManagementTest.php
- **Next Steps / Fixes Needed:** Implement Laravel Breeze for standard web authentication or create custom controllers for user authentication and management.
