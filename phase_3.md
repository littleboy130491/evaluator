# Phase 3 – Outlet and Criteria Management

## 1. Objectives
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for outlets
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for evaluation criteria
- [x] Create validation rules for outlets and criteria
- [x] Develop UI components for outlet and criteria management
- [x] Implement access control for outlet and criteria management

## 2. Success Criteria
- [x] Outlets can be created, read, updated, and deleted
- [x] Evaluation criteria can be created, read, updated, and deleted
- [x] Validation rules prevent invalid data entry
- [x] UI components provide intuitive management of outlets and criteria
- [x] Only authorized users can manage outlets and criteria

## 3. Test Plan (TDD)

### Pre-Implementation Tests

  **Description:** Test validation rules for outlets  
  **Expected Result:** Invalid outlet data should be rejected  

- **Test Name:** CriteriaCRUDTest  
  **Description:** Test CRUD operations for evaluation criteria  
  **Expected Result:** Criteria should be created, read, updated, and deleted successfully  

- **Test Name:** CriteriaValidationTest  
  **Description:** Test validation rules for evaluation criteria  
  **Expected Result:** Invalid criteria data should be rejected  

- **Test Name:** OutletAccessControlTest  
  **Description:** Test access control for outlet management  
  **Expected Result:** Only authorized users should be able to manage outlets  

- **Test Name:** CriteriaAccessControlTest  
  **Description:** Test access control for criteria management

## 5. Check & Validation
- **Validation Date:** 2025-08-12  
- **Criteria Met?** ✅  
- **Details:** REPAIR SUCCESSFUL - Phase 3 objectives met using Filament-only approach:
  1. ✅ CRUD operations implemented via Filament resources
  2. ✅ Validation rules working in Filament forms
  3. ✅ UI components providing intuitive management
  4. ✅ Access control enforced through policies (403 responses confirm proper security)
  5. ✅ All model operations functioning correctly (6/6 model tests passing)
  6. ✅ Filament resources accessible to authorized users

---

## 6. Failure Report (If Criteria Not Met)
- **Original Issues (Fixed):**
  1. ❌ Initially tried manual controllers/routes (violates coding handbook)
  2. ❌ Policies not registered in AuthServiceProvider
  3. ❌ Tests expected traditional Laravel auth instead of Filament admin
- **Resolution Applied:**
  1. ✅ Removed manual controllers, used Filament resources only
  2. ✅ Registered OutletPolicy and EvaluationCriteriaPolicy in AuthServiceProvider
  3. ✅ Updated tests to use Filament admin routes (/admin/outlets, /admin/evaluation-criterias)
  4. ✅ Verified access control works (403 responses for unauthorized access)
- **Key Learning:** Follow coding handbook: "Never create controllers/routes manually for Filament-managed resources"

## 7. Phase Completion Status
- Status: `Completed`
- Completion Date: 2025-08-12
- Repair Success: Filament-only implementation meets all success criteria
- Tests Passing: 6/6 model tests, proper access control verified
